*VNW Mappings:
*Please refer to VehicleInterfaceSignals for signal Ids.
*The mappings are configurable and you can edit signal Ids and their associated values.
*key-mapping corresponds to the Android key event.
*Please refer to Android's KeyEvent.java for key-mappings.
*
*Mapping/intent is triggered when (reported-value & value-mask) == value (if value-mask is specified).
*If value-mask not specified, value-mask by default is ~0.
*This attribute was defined as flag in previous releases, and it is still parsed for compatibility
*
*One can configure whether vnw should send intent and injectEvent or one of them.
*handling-mask= 0x00000001 will make vnw send out intent.
*handling-mask= 0x00000002 will make vnw inject the actual key-event.
*We can OR multiple mask values if needed.
*handling-mask= 0x00000003 will make vnw send intent as well as inject event.
*handling-mask is optional, handling-mask by default is 0x00000003.
*
*type attribute default value is 'on_change'
*type='on_change' has to be selected when changes in value signal have to trigger
* an android key event, and same value refreshes need to be dropped
*type='on_refresh' has to be used when signals repeating same value on every key press
* have to trigger an android key event, this can flood android events if signal is
* periodically sending same values at a fixed rate
*NOTE:when receiving the 1st frame with many signal values set to 0, they are dropped to
* prevent sending all key events when first key data is sent
*
*action attribute default value is 'keydownup'
*action='keydown' will send key event with ACTION_DOWN in android when value is received
*action='keyup' will send key event with ACTION_UP on android when value is received
*action='keydownup' will send key event with ACTION_DOWN followed by ACTION_UP when value is received
*
*Following are some of the keys events being supported right now.
*Please refer to VehicleSignalConstants for corresponding intent strings.
